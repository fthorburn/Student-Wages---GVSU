This project analyzes student wages as well as meal costs over time.

Meal costs here refers to the functional cost of a single meal when a student purchases the "5+ meal plan" in the GVSU dining system from 2019 to 2022. 

First, dining dollars are subtracted from the cost of purchasing the plan, so we can observe a comparable number of meal costs. (Cost without dining dollars)
Then, cost is divided by the number of meals in the plan. This number is tracked from 2019 to 2022. (Cost per meal without dining dollars).
